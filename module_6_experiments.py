"""
Real-Time Sentiment Analysis System
Module 6: AI Exploration Experiments

This module tests the trained model with various experimental inputs
to understand its behavior, limitations, and edge cases.

Experiments:
1. Unexpected inputs the model was not trained on
2. Real-world personal inputs
3. Modification effects on predictions
4. Sarcasm detection challenge
5. Edge cases and stress testing

    EXPERIMENT 1: Unexpected Inputs
    - Model handles unfamiliar text by defaulting to neutral
    - Technical jargon classification depends on sentiment words
    - Gibberish and random text classified as neutral
    
    EXPERIMENT 2: Real-World Inputs
    - Clear sentiment expressions detected accurately
    - Casual and informal language may be misclassified
    - Performance varies with phrasing and context
    
    EXPERIMENT 3: Modification Effects
    - Preprocessing normalizes case and punctuation
    - Negation handling is a known weakness
    - Stretched words may not match vocabulary
    
    EXPERIMENT 4: Sarcasm Detection
    - Traditional ML models struggle with sarcasm
    - Word-level analysis misses intended meaning
    - Transformer models recommended for improvement
    
    EXPERIMENT 5: Edge Cases
    - Empty inputs handled gracefully
    - Single words classified by word sentiment
    - Long text and mixed sentiment are challenging
    
    KEY TAKEAWAYS:
    - No model is perfect; understanding limitations is important
    - Preprocessing choices significantly impact results
    - Real-world text is messy and diverse
    - Continuous testing improves model reliability
